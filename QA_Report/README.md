## QA Report
This component based on the Voilà OSS allows the visualization a live Quality Report that is the ouput of the Quality Report (Jupyter notebook) execution.
The Quality Report definition (Jupyter Notebook) is stored in the QI Metadata Catalog. The QA Report Manager downloads the Quality Report definition from the catalog and deploys it in the Voilà environment for execution and output display.
